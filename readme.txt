Goals:
    
    Balance the stats and equipments of all vanilla fighters. Make factions play uniquely.
    Balance factions to have a 50/50 chance of winning/losing in battles with roughly equal troop compositions, 
        equal power levels, and without the aid of any captain perks. (Just straight up troops vs troops)

Changes: 

    Updated, Buffed, and finely Balanced stats and loadouts of all Vanilla Standard/Royal/Militia/Mercenary/Bandit Troops:

        Stats updated according to Stat Rules (See "rules.txt").

    Updated loadouts of recruits:

        Recruits now have a 1/2 chance to take a non-peasant weapon to battle.

        Recruits no longer take scythes to the battlefield.

    Updated loadouts of troop trees in general:

        Fixed many disparities in gear quality as troops advanced through their factions' upgrade trees.

        Added/Removed/Changed weapons of certain troops to make them more useful to their roles.

    Updated NPC parties:
        
        TODO: NPC parties will now have more diverse troops and will make use of all their factions' troops.
        NPC parties across factions now have more equal starting numbers

        TODO: Forest/Sea-Raider/Mountain/Desert/Steppe Bandit parties will now always include a Bandit Boss


    Updated some weapons to be more useful and offer more variety.

    

To install:

    1.) Unzip me into your "Mount & Blade II Bannerlord/Modules" folder.

    2.) If in a game that was started using vanilla troops, start a new SandBox / StoryMode campaign with the mod active.
        (Blame TaleWorlds for this, it can't be helped)
