Goals:
    
    Balance the stats and equipments of all vanilla fighters. Make factions play uniquely.
    Balance factions to have a 50/50 chance of winning/losing in battles with roughly equal troop compositions, 
        equal power levels, and without the aid of any captain perks. (Just straight up troops vs troops)

Changes: 

    Updated, buffed, and finely balanced stats and loadouts of all Vanilla Standard/Royal/Militia/Mercenary/Bandit Troops:

        TODO: Militia/Merc/Bandits

        Stats updated according to Stat Rules (See "rules.txt").

    Loadouts of troops:

        Recruits have a 1/2 chance to spawn with a non-peasant weapon, and no longer equip scythes.

        Fixed many disparities in gear quality as troops advanced through their factions' upgrade trees.
            (i.e. troops won't ever get worse gear upon level up)

        Added/Removed/Changed weapons and armors of almost all troops to make them more useful,
            more fitting to their roles, and more balanced.

    NPC party spawns:

        TODO: NPC parties will now spawn with more diverse troops and will spawn making use of all their factions' troops.
        NPC parties across factions now have more equal starting numbers.

        TODO: Forest/Sea-Raider/Mountain/Desert/Steppe Bandit parties will now always include a Bandit Boss.

    Gear:
        Updated vanilla weapons to offer more use and variety.

        Created new weapons to offer more use and variety.

        Updated armors to offer more use and variety.

    AI:
        
        Tweaked various AI settings to make in-mission troops generally less weak.

        Troops will now spawn with entire equipment rosters. Meaning however they appear in the
            encyclopedia is exacatly how they will appear on the battle field.

        Included most of RBM's AI logic. From it, I removed the frontline behavior where troops
            battle very meekly. I also removed their AI stat parameters in favor of my own.

    Gameplay:

        When going from normal horse to war horse upon upgrading one of your troops, you will retrieve the horse which
            the troop was using before. Didn't make sense to me that horses would just be thrown away.
