Goals:
    
    Balance the stats and equipments of all vanilla fighters. Make factions play uniquely.
    Balance factions to have a 50/50 chance of winning/losing in battles with roughly equal troop compositions, 
        equal power levels, and without the aid of any captain perks. (Just straight up troops vs troops)

Changes: 

    Updated, buffed, and finely balanced stats and loadouts of all Vanilla Standard/Royal/Militia/Mercenary/Bandit Troops:

        TODO: Militia/Merc/Bandits

        Stats updated according to Stat Rules (See "rules.txt").

    Updated loadouts of recruits:

        Recruits now have a 1/2 chance to take a non-peasant weapon to battle.

        Recruits no longer take scythes to the battlefield.

    Updated loadouts of troop trees in general:

        Fixed many disparities in gear quality as troops advanced through their factions' upgrade trees.

        Added/Removed/Changed weapons and armors of almost all troops to make them more useful and fitting to their roles.

    Updated NPC party spawns:

        TODO: NPC parties will now spawn with more diverse troops and will spawn making use of all their factions' troops.
        NPC parties across factions now have more equal starting numbers.

        TODO: Forest/Sea-Raider/Mountain/Desert/Steppe Bandit parties will now always include a Bandit Boss.

    Gear:
        Updated vanilla weapons and created new weapons to offer more use and variety.

        Update armors to offer more use and variety.

    AI:
        
        Tweaked various AI settings to make in-mission troops generally less weak.
